Object Detection API with Hugging Face's DETR Model
This repository contains a Flask web application for object detection using Hugging Face's DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model with ResNet-50 backbone. This API allows users to send an image and receive predictions regarding the objects detected in that image.

Getting Started
To get started with this API, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system
pip package manager
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/detr-flask-api.git
Navigate into the cloned directory:
bash
Copy code
cd detr-flask-api
Install the required Python packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Obtain an API token from Hugging Face's Model Hub.
Replace the placeholder token in the API_URL variable in app.py with your actual API token.
Run the Flask application:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Once the application is running, you can send a POST request with an image file to get predictions. The endpoint for prediction is /predict.
Example
You can use tools like cURL or Postman to send POST requests to the API endpoint. Here's an example using cURL:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict
Replace /path/to/your/image.jpg with the path to the image file you want to analyze.

Response
The API will respond with a JSON object containing the labels of the objects detected in the image.
